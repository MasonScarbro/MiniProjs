Note: only adding .javas to this folder meant to keep things simple

* DerivPoly this will take any string polynomial and give you the derivative (I chose this because i struggle with string play and it shows)
* DerivativePolyImproved This is a far superior version to the previous im only keeping the other one because it shows progress I guess?
